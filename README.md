A simple Weather Forecast app, where the user can enter the name of a place in Great Britain and see the weather forecast over the next five days. The app shows the average temperature (in Kelvin), pressure (in hectopascals) and humidity percentage.

This app was developed following Udemy's [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/t/lecture/6994532?start=0) tutorial, with the aim of improving my understanding of React and Redux.
