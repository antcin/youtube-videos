    this.state = { term: '' }; // state is initialised by creating a new object and assigning it to this.state. The object we pass contains properties that we want to record in state. In this case we want to record the property `term` on state. Whenever user updates the search input, `term ` is the property we want to record that change on.

//SearchBar makes use of state by updating the user input whenever the state changes. Whenever the user enters some text we first update the state, which causes the entire component to re-render. We made the input element a controlled component by telling it to receive its value from state.
